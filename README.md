# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project was completed as part of the CodSoft Virtual Internship. The goal is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, making it an excellent case study for real-world fraud detection scenarios.

---

## Objective

To build a model that can accurately determine whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or legitimate based on transaction features.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is a publicly available anonymized credit card transaction dataset containing:
- `Time`, `Amount` and 28 anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`)
- Class labels: `0` (Legit) and `1` (Fraud)

---

## Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing and Normalization
- Handling Imbalanced Data using SMOTE
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
- Model Training with:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve

---

## Results

The model achieved strong classification performance on the imbalanced dataset. It can serve as a prototype for real-world fraud detection systems.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo or open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   `credit_card_fraud.ipynb`
2. Make sure the required libraries are installed:
3.  Run each cell step-by-step and observe the output.
